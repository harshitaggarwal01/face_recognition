This was supposed to be faster but it isn't for some reason which i would like to figure out... stick to previous examples.

Still, to make it work:
1. install the required libraries (face_recognition, opencv, and some more boring basic ones like pillow etc.).
2. make sure that the file(s) are in the same directory.
3. change/add names of the people from variables and change/add them to array of names.
